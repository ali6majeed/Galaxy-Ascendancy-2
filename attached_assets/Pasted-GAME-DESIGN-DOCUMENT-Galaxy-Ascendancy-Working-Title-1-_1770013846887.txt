GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT

Galaxy Ascendancy (Working Title)

⸻

1. Technical Foundation (Unity)

The game is built using Unity and designed from day one as a server-authoritative, persistent MMO strategy title.

The Unity client is responsible for rendering, UI, animations, and player input, while all gameplay logic, combat resolution, resource generation, and progression validation are handled on backend servers.

The project is structured to support:
	•	Long-term live operations (years)
	•	Continuous content injection without server wipes
	•	Large player populations per galaxy

Unity systems used:
	•	Addressables for live content delivery
	•	ScriptableObjects for balance, units, buildings, and shield data
	•	Remote config for economy tuning
	•	Deterministic combat simulations for replays

⸻

2. Core Design Philosophy

This game does not reset, reboot, or wipe progress.

Players invest time and money (Uranium) with the expectation that:
	•	Their planet always exists
	•	Their progress always matters
	•	Power can be challenged but not erased

The universe evolves instead of restarting.

3. Game Overview

The player is an interstellar ruler who controls a personal planet inside a shared galaxy.
The long-term objective is to dominate the galaxy by occupying the Ideal Planet, becoming the King of the Galaxy, and maintaining control against constant opposition from other players and alliances.

The core loop is:
Build → Expand → Ally → Wage War → Dominate → Defend → Adapt

⸻

4. Galaxy Structure (Persistent)

Each galaxy functions as a permanent server shard.

The galaxy contains:
	•	Player-owned planets
	•	Neutral NPC factions
	•	Resource zones and anomalies
	•	The Ideal Planet at the galaxy’s center

To avoid overcrowding and stagnation, new star systems are unlocked over time. These systems seamlessly expand the galaxy map using Unity Addressables, allowing continuous growth without resets.

⸻

5. Player Planet Design

Each player owns one primary planet.

The planet is divided into three gameplay layers:

Orbit Layer
Used for orbital defenses, fleet docks, and space-based structures.

Surface Layer
Contains all city buildings and resource fields, using a Travian-style expandable grid.

Core Layer
Unlocked in late game and focused on energy management, advanced technologies, and high-tier bonuses.

⸻

6. Resource System (Narrative Description)

The economy revolves around four primary resources, all generated directly on the player’s planet.

Metal is the backbone of construction. It is required for buildings, ships, defensive platforms, and most physical structures.

Crystal represents advanced materials and technology. It is heavily used for research, shield systems, and high-tier units.

Oxygen represents population sustain and biological support. It limits fleet size, population growth, and prolonged military operations.

Energy is not stored like other resources. Instead, it acts as a capacity system. Every building, shield, and advanced structure consumes energy to function. If energy production is insufficient, buildings operate at reduced efficiency.

Resource production scales infinitely, but costs increase exponentially, naturally slowing progression without hard caps.

7. Premium Currency – Uranium

Uranium is the permanent premium currency purchased through the app stores.

Key principles:
	•	Uranium is never wiped or reset
	•	Uranium does not provide direct combat power
	•	Uranium protects long-term player trust

Uranium can be used for:
	•	Construction and research acceleration
	•	Emergency repairs
	•	Cosmetic upgrades (planets, fleets, UI)
	•	Convenience features (extra build queues, automation tools)

⸻

8. Buildings & Progression

There is no maximum level for buildings.

Instead:
	•	Upgrade times and costs scale exponentially
	•	Progress slows naturally at high levels
	•	Strategic decisions matter more than raw speed

Building categories include:
	•	Resource generation
	•	Military production
	•	Research and technology
	•	Infrastructure and logistics
	•	Alliance-support structures

All balance values are controlled via ScriptableObjects for safe live tuning.

⸻

9. Fleet & Combat System

Players build fleets consisting of multiple ship classes, each serving a tactical role. Combat is resolved on the server using deterministic calculations, ensuring fairness and scalability.

Combat outcomes depend on:
	•	Fleet composition
	•	Technology levels
	•	Commander bonuses
	•	Formation and timing

Players can view full battle replays generated by the server and rendered in Unity.

⸻

10. The Ideal Planet (Endgame Focus)

The Ideal Planet exists permanently at the galaxy’s center and serves as the main source of conflict.

It cannot be destroyed or removed.

⸻

11. The Ten-Layer Shield System

The Ideal Planet is protected by ten massive shield layers.

Each shield layer:
	•	Has its own mechanics and resistances
	•	Regenerates over time if not fully destroyed
	•	Requires specific fleet compositions to counter

Shield layers must be destroyed sequentially. Multiple alliances often participate in shield assaults, making cooperation and timing critical.

⸻

12. Occupation & Kingship

When all ten shield layers are destroyed, the planet becomes occupiable.

The player who successfully occupies it becomes the King of the Galaxy.

While ruling:
	•	The King gains a permanent 20% personal resource production bonus
	•	Their alliance gains a smaller shared bonus
	•	The galaxy visually changes to reflect their rule
	•	The King can issue limited galaxy-wide decrees

⸻

13. Shield Rebuilding & Defense

Once occupied, the Ideal Planet becomes vulnerable until its shields are rebuilt.

Rebuilding shields:
	•	Requires massive resources
	•	Takes significant real-time duration
	•	Becomes more expensive the longer the same ruler holds power

Failure to maintain shields invites rebellion.

⸻

14. Anti-Stagnation Systems (Critical)

To prevent permanent dominance without wiping progress, the game includes power decay systems.

As a ruler holds power longer:
	•	Shield maintenance costs increase
	•	NPC factions grow more aggressive
	•	Attackers gain minor efficiency bonuses

This ensures constant pressure and long-term conflict without invalidating past progress.

⸻

15. Alliances & Politics

Alliances are essential to success.

Alliance features include:
	•	Shared technologies
	•	Coordinated warfare tools
	•	Resource donation systems
	•	Political treaties and non-aggression pacts

Diplomacy is encouraged, but betrayal is always possible.

⸻

16. Cross-Galaxy Warfare (No Resets)

Instead of server merges or seasonal resets, galaxies connect via Intergalactic Gates.

Top alliances and kings from multiple galaxies can engage in cross-galaxy wars without risking their home galaxy.

Rewards are prestige-based:
	•	Titles
	•	Cosmetics
	•	Permanent minor bonuses

⸻

17. Long-Term Content Strategy

The universe remains fresh through:
	•	New ship classes
	•	New shield types
	•	New NPC factions
	•	New galaxy laws
	•	New star systems

All content is injected live using Unity Addressables and remote configuration.

⸻

18. Why This Game Lasts for Years
	•	No wipes → permanent investment value
	•	Continuous conflict → no end state
	•	Power decay → no stagnation
	•	Galaxy expansion → no overcrowding
	•	Uranium retains value forever

This is a true persistent galaxy MMO, not a seasonal strategy game.
